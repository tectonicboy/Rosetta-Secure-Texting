You can use these two if you're wondering what the package name string is
for a package in apt that needs to be installed to meet a dependancy that
you're missing while installing something and it only tells you roughly
what the dependancy is, like "needs OpenGL but not found", not a package string:

apt-cache 'whatever'

apt-file 'header file'
