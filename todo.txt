1. Get rid of dereferencing type-punned pointers, it's undefined behaviour.
[ Completed ✓ ]

2. Remove checks for non-null ptrs in cleanup paths. Free accepts NULL pointers.
[ Completed ✓ ]

3. Rewrite lost code for finding new diffie-hellman ~ 3072-bit primes.

4. Finish function pointers for AF_UNIX vs Internet socket function variants.

5. Implement the rest of the Rosetta Test Framework with AF_UNIX communication.

6. Get a clean compile with -O3 on all 10,000+ lines of code, not just -O2.

7. Run linters and static analyzers/sanitizers from GCC/clang, plus Valgrind.

?. Replace if(ret_err){print_err; return;}else{print_good;} with a #define that
   uses __LINE__ and __FILE__ instead of specific strings for all error types.

?. Fix argon2 implementation to work for further passes too.

?. Write benchmarks and correctness tests for BigInt/Cryptography algorithms.

?. Rewrite Montgomery Modular Multiplication w/ intrinsics for more CPUs.

?. Make cryptography algorithms constant-time to avoid side channel attacks.

?. Write a full fledged documentation + description for Rosetta.

?. Specify exactly what global/local state bookkeeping is needed by each
   function (especially packet processing) in Server and Client.

?. Come up with a better unique packet ID numbering. Currently the same packet
   ID exists in server and in client. BAD!

?. Make a better interface for gen_pub_key to not require the private key
   in a temporary file.

?. Get rid of having to manually free the .bits buffer of bigints. Instead,
   implement some bigint destruction strategy or at least a simple API.
