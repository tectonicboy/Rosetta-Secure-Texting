1. Get rid of dereferencing type-punned pointers, it's undefined behaviour.
[ Completed ✓ ]

2. Remove checks for non-null ptrs in cleanup paths. Free accepts NULL pointers.
[ Completed ✓ ]

3. Rewrite lost code for finding new diffie-hellman ~ 3072-bit primes.
[ Completed ✓ ]

4. Finish function pointers for AF_UNIX vs Internet socket function variants.
[ Completed ✓ ]

5. Implement the rest of the Rosetta Test Framework with AF_UNIX communication.
[ Completed ✓ ]

6. If a user relogs quickly, server says Public Key already exists and does not
   permit the user to log back in. Fix it.
[ Completed ✓ ]

7. Get a clean compile with -O3 on all 10,000+ lines of code, not just -O2.
[ Completed ✓ ]

8. Get rid of having to manually free the .bits buffer of bigints. Instead,
   implement some bigint destruction strategy or at least a simple API.
[ Completed ✓ ]

9. Remove code for Argon2 further passes. One pass will suffice.

10. Make a special memory allocation scheme where instead of bigint_create()
    spamming malloc in the hot path of authenticate_client()/server(), we have
    a preallocated memory arena for bigints that we know will be required for
    the functions in that hot path, and tell the functions how to access the
    bigints from the preallocated arena. Create this arena at initialization,
    free it at shutdown. Look at the before and after perf report analysis, cuz
    now with the malloc spam, it was saying some large numbers about malloc.
    Heap allocation spam in the hot path is highly disliked in performance
    analysis.

11. C++ wxWidgets GUI for message sending when joining/creating a chatroom.
    Try using the AF_UNIX communication code for this too.

12. Profile-guided optimization, __restrict__, const wherever I can.

13. Run linters and static analyzers/sanitizers from GCC/clang, plus Valgrind.

14. Write the project whitepaper report.

?. Improve the Rosetta Test Framework with automatic tests. All actions, from
   creating and logging in a test user account, to creating and joining a
   chatroom, to sending a text message, should be done automatically when you
   start a test case. The function APIs for all of these are already made.

?. Improve handling of fundamental cryptographic artifacts like M, Q and G.
    Make sure only one place in the Server and Client loads them at init time.
    lib/coreutils.h should probably be removed/reworked entirely anyway.

?. Montgomery Modular Multiplication is currently hardcoded to use the same      
   Diffie-Hellman modulus M as its multiplication modulus. It doesn't have to be 
   that way. Computing MU and L (the 2 parameters that depend on the Montgomery  
   Modulus) is simple - L is the number of 64-bit limbs (8-byte chunks) in the   
   Montgomery Modulus, MU is the multiplicative inverse, the algorithm to get it 
   for any Montgomery Modulus is only a few lines of code. Make it so that       
   Montgomery Modular Multiplication takes any modulus, gets L and MU for it,    
   and successfully performs fast modular multiplication and powering. Then it   
   will be usable even in Rabin-Miller primality test, which will significantly  
   speed it up I assume. 

?. Make cryptography algorithms constant-time to avoid side channel attacks.

?. Write a full fledged documentation + description for Rosetta.

?. Come up with a better unique packet ID numbering. Currently the same packet
   ID exists in server and in client. BAD!

?. Make a better interface for gen_pub_key to not require the private key
   in a temporary file.
