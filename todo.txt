1. Get rid of dereferencing type-punned pointers, it's undefined behaviour.
[ Completed ✓ ]

2. Remove checks for non-null ptrs in cleanup paths. Free accepts NULL pointers.
[ Completed ✓ ]

3. Rewrite lost code for finding new diffie-hellman ~ 3072-bit primes.
[ Completed ✓ ]

4. Finish function pointers for AF_UNIX vs Internet socket function variants.
[ Completed ✓ ]

5. Implement the rest of the Rosetta Test Framework with AF_UNIX communication.
[ In progress ]

          TODO: Test more connection timeout scenarios with CTRL+Z to the side
                we want to "lose connection" without the OS alerting connected
                processes or TCP sending FIN packets to connected machines.

          BUG:  Scenario is:

                1. kevin, levin, devin log in, in that order.
                2. kev makes a room.
                3. levin joins it, devi joins it, in that order.
                4. they send some messages.
                5. kev (room owner) abruptly loses connection to server (CTRL+Z)
                6. Others are notified of it, get booted.
                7. Others press ENTER a few times to fix scanf, back to menu.
                8. devi creates a new room, without logging out.
                9. levin joins devi's new room.
               10. kev logs back in, joins devi's new room too.
               --> BUGGED. Find out why. 

6. If a user relogs quickly, server says Public Key already exists and does not
   permit the user to log back in. Fix it.

7. Get a clean compile with -O3 on all 10,000+ lines of code, not just -O2.

8. Run linters and static analyzers/sanitizers from GCC/clang, plus Valgrind.

9. Montgomery Modular Multiplication is currently hardcoded to use the same      
   Diffie-Hellman modulus M as its multiplication modulus. It doesn't have to be 
   that way. Computing MU and L (the 2 parameters that depend on the Montgomery  
   Modulus) is simple - L is the number of 64-bit limbs (8-byte chunks) in the   
   Montgomery Modulus, MU is the multiplicative inverse, the algorithm to get it 
   for any Montgomery Modulus is only a few lines of code. Make it so that       
   Montgomery Modular Multiplication takes any modulus, gets L and MU for it,    
   and successfully performs fast modular multiplication and powering. Then it   
   will be usable even in Rabin-Miller primality test, which will significantly  
   speed it up I assume. 

?. Replace if(ret_err){print_err; return;}else{print_good;} with a #define that
   uses __LINE__ and __FILE__ instead of specific strings for all error types.

?. Fix argon2 implementation to work for further passes too.

?. Write benchmarks and correctness tests for BigInt/Cryptography algorithms.

?. Rewrite Montgomery Modular Multiplication w/ intrinsics for more CPUs.

?. Make cryptography algorithms constant-time to avoid side channel attacks.

?. Write a full fledged documentation + description for Rosetta.

?. Specify exactly what global/local state bookkeeping is needed by each
   function (especially packet processing) in Server and Client.

?. Come up with a better unique packet ID numbering. Currently the same packet
   ID exists in server and in client. BAD!

?. Make a better interface for gen_pub_key to not require the private key
   in a temporary file.

?. Get rid of having to manually free the .bits buffer of bigints. Instead,
   implement some bigint destruction strategy or at least a simple API.
