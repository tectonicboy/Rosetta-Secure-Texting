1. Get rid of dereferencing type-punned pointers, it's undefined behaviour.

SO FAR: Removed all such code from bigint.h, cryptolib.h, server.c and
        server-packet-functions.h

        Now doing client-packet-functions.h


2. Fix argon2 implementation to work for further passes too.

3. Rewrite lost code for finding new diffie-hellman ~ 3072-bit primes.

4. Finish function pointers for AF_UNIX vs Internet socket function variants.

5. Implement the rest of the Rosetta Test Framework with AF_UNIX communication.

6. Get a clean compile with -O3 on all 10,000+ lines of code, not just -O2.

7. Run linters and static analyzers/sanitizers from GCC/clang, plus Valgrind.

?. Write benchmarks and correctness tests for BigInt/Cryptography algorithms.

?. Rewrite Montgomery Modular Multiplication w/ intrinsics/code for more CPUs.

?. Make cryptography algorithms constant-time to avoid side channel attacks.

?. Write a full fledged documentation + description for Rosetta.

?. Come up with a better unique packet ID numbering. Currently the same packet
   ID exists in server and in client. BAD!
