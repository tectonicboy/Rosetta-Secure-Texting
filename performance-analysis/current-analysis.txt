Top-down performance analysis method showed us that the Rosetta server is
already well optimized.

Level 1 buckets:

Retiring:        71.6% [Very good]
Backend-bound:   15.7%
Frontend-bound:  6.6%
Bad speculation: 6.1%

This is already pretty good and any optimization work should probably focus on
the backend-bound bucket.

Drill down one level deeper into the level 2 buckets of Backend-bound:

Further reveals:

BE-bound sub-bucket 1: Core-bound   = 9.8% <--- Focus optimization efforts here.
BE-bound sub-bucket 2: Memory-bound = 5.5%

This suggests the system is utilizing the cache hierarchy very well, and that
any optimization efforts should focus on the CPU execution engines. Perhaps
a dependency chain meant not all micro-op units could be utilised, or other
issues related to microcode execution.

Additionally, with individual performance counters captured, I revealed:

- Extremely low L1 DATA cache misses as a % to all accesses. [GOOD]

- Noticable L1 INSTRUCTION cache misses, unable to get a % to all accesses. [?]

- Very low L3 combined cache misses as a % to accesses, indicating the L1 icache
  misses do get resolved by the time L3 cache is reached. [GOOD]

- Very small branch misprediction ratio to all branch events. [GOOD]

-----------------
NEXT STEPS:

- Repeat this analysis several times to make sure stable results are presisting.
- Improve function profiling code to report stable execution time averages.
